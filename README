Some work in python for a discrete structures course
I took about a year ago.

This is an example of work done in Python to solve the
travelling salesman problem.  The problem states:
given a weighted graph, what is the cheapest possible
route that visits each node exactly once and returns
to the origin city?

This program implements a few famous algorithms
to solve this combinatorics problem.
